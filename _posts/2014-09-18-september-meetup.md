It's #maptime again. #Maptime is time for learning and sharing knowledge at the intersection of "Maps" and "The Internet". Beginners are welcome. Bring your computer so that you can work on your projects.

Maptime starts with short show and tell. Attendees demonstrate the current projects and share key lessons, or ask for assistance. Maptime proceeds with workshop time when attendees self-study, or assemble in ad-hoc groups for collaboration.

Maptime is friendly, diverse and inclusive. Join us.
