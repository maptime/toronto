Thanks to all that made it out to the [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) workshop in January!

The workshop materials have been compiled into a [web tutorial](http://joshuafrazier.info/leaflet-basics/) so that you can continue learning at your own pace.

For further info, see the official [Leaflet tutorials](http://leafletjs.com/examples.html) and the [Maptime](http://maptime.io/lessons-resources/#web-mapping) web mapping resources.

See you next month!
