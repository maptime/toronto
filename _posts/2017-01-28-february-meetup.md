### Mapping plus 3D Printing Demo!

3D Printing has been a tool that is starting to mature. Join *Claus Rinner* and *Selasi Dorkenoo* as they demonstrate what has been done and can be done with GIS and a 3D Printer. We can also help attendees turn their GIS project into a printable 3D model at this event so be sure, so be sure to bring your projects. If you have prior experience and software in using 3D printing, bring that as well!

Bring a laptop! While it isn't mandatory, hands-on learning and helping others is the best way to learn. There are many opportunities to break out and work on side projects with people you meet to build on the skills you learned earlier, or learn new ones!

Beginners are especially welcome. If you already know everything there is about 3D printing, but want to help or work on mapping projects during the event, this is also the place for you! There will be internet, and pizza supplied by [Carto](https://carto.com/)!

Maptime is friendly, diverse and inclusive.
