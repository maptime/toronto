### Learn Version Control with Git and Github

Version control, it's something that many geographers and new developers hear about, and it's something that developers treat akin to breathing.

What is Git? How can it help me or my team? How can I learn it? What good is it for?

These questions will be answered with an overview and a breakout that will give everyone the bare basics to demystify, learn and expand on this skill that the best organizations use to collaborate and cooperate on complex projects.

Bring a laptop! While it isn't mandatory, hands-on learning and helping others is the best way to learn so we can't emphasize this strong enough! If you haven't connected to the Wifi at Ryerson before, we also recommend you come a bit early so that you can connect with the wifi.

Beginners are especially welcome. If you already know how to use Git but want to help or work on mapping projects during the event, this is also the place for you!

Maptime is friendly, diverse and inclusive.
