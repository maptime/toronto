### Data Formats and Conversions

It's #maptime again!  Maptime is all about learning and sharing knowledge at the intersection of "Maps" and "The Internet".

This month Stewart Russell will share his experience from the trenches of using geo-data.  Specifically, Stewart will show us some tips and tricks for converting data from provided formats, to desired formats.

As always, we will have a short show and tell where anyone is free to demonstrate their current projects, share key lessons, and/or ask for assistance. Then there will be workshop time where attendees can self-study or assemble in ad-hoc groups for collaboration.

Beginners are welcome. Bring a laptop so that you can work on your projects.

Maptime is friendly, diverse and inclusive. Please join us.
