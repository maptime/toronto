Join us Thursday August 21st for the next Maptime Toronto! We're back at the Mozilla Community Space for August so many thanks to Mozilla for the support!

### Talk: Webmaps and your data

[Tristen](https://github.com/tristen) will be giving a presentation on various methods to add your own custom data to a map.

### Hack, Code, and Build

After the presentation we'll have our usual coding session. We'll each get to one of our projects, or collaborate with others on theirs.  There might also be some networking, and perhaps some refreshments off-site afterwards.

Doors at 6:30 with the action starting shortly after. 

Bring your laptops, enthusiasm, experience, projects and any questions. Beginners encouraged!

### Date and Time
