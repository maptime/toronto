It's #maptime again.  #Maptime is time for learning and sharing knowledge at the intersection of "Maps" and "The Internet".  Beginners are welcome!  Bring your computer so that you can work on your projects.

Maptime starts with a short show and tell.  Attendees are invited to share current projects, resources and tools, best practices, or ask for assistance.  Don't have anything to share this month?  No worries!  We are happy for participants to join us to learn and network.  Maptime proceeds with workshop time when attendees self-study, or assemble in ad-hoc groups for collaboration.

Past topics include Leaflet, Mapbox, Mozilla Stumbler, OpenStreetMap, and QGIS.

We strive to be friendly, diverse and inclusive and are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of colour, ethnic origin, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for our events. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers.

Please join us!
