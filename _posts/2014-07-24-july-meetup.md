Join us Thursday July 24th for the next Maptime Toronto! Venue space has been generously donated by Ryerson University's Department of Geography and the Master of Spatial Analysis program.

### Show and Tell

It's #maptime.  Maptime July 2014 will be a "Show and Tell" event in addition to our heads-down coding.  We'll have a few members give short talks about their projects.  They'll talk about what's interesting, what's challenging, what's frustrating and what they've learned.  Each presentation will be a bite-sized three to five minutes, and there will be no advertising or oogey sales-pitches.

### Hack, Code, and Build

After the presentations we'll have our usual coding session. We'll each get to one of our projects, or collaborate with others on theirs.  There might also be some networking, and perhaps some refreshments off-site afterwards.

Doors at 6:30 with the action starting shortly after. 

Bring your laptops, enthusiasm, experience, projects and any questions. Beginners encouraged!
