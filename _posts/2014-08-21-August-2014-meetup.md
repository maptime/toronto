Join us Thursday August 21st for the next Maptime Toronto! We're back at the Mozilla Community Space for August so many thanks to Mozilla for the support!

### Show and Tell

It's #maptime.  Maptime August 2014 will include a short presentation, tentatively titled, "QGIS for beginners" by Tristen, "Show and Tell" in addition to our heads-down coding.  

### Hack, Code, and Build

After the presentations we'll have our usual coding session. We'll each get to one of our projects, or collaborate with others on theirs.  There might also be some networking, and perhaps some refreshments off-site afterwards.

Doors at 6:30 with the action starting shortly after. 

Bring your laptops, enthusiasm, experience, projects and any questions. Beginners encouraged!
